The file along with this is apython program designed for the user in the form of an AI ChatBot by using streamlit template and LangChain LLMs 
The LangChain LLM is used for connecting the user input with the AI output with the help of tools
I have used Weather tool by using the coordinate of the places memtioned by the user
For OpenAI source i have used GROQ in which specifically "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" is used
The API key is also in the program because i dont think it could be misused . As it is a Open source free AI the credits arent lost 
The important thing why that is there is because i didnt want to keep it in (.secret) folder and i tried keeping it but it showed me some error like ImportError .
So i let it public.I hope it doesnt affect your impression on me.
I used two tools here i.e. Weather and AImessage tool 
I also used text inputs for place and date because i think it looks good and organised which could be removed and only the search tab could be kept
